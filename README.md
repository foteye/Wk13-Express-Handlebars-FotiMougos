### Brief:

In this assignment, I've created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a custom ORM. The program will allow users to log burgers, and decide whether or not they are devoured. Funnily enough, you can eat/un-eat burgers?

### Lessons Learned:

  * Late homework - this was possibly the hardest thing I've ever worked on.
  * I became alot more comfortable using handlebars as I debugged issues with this
  * Getting better at pulling apart problems with SQL queries
  * Tried doing some destructuring and template? `${variable}` thingys and it looks alot neater than string concatenation over multiple lines
  * For all the effort you go into with express handlebars, not amazing. Can achieve similar results (and arguably more easily) with the original AngularJS implementation...
